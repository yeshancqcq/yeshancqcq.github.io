<p>Let’s go back
<br>
Let’s go back to Pleistocene
<br>
When the homo sapiens just took the stage
<br>
Though the sun would shine
<br>
the globe dropped some degrees
<br>
It was a cool time
<br>
We call it Ice Age
<br>
Let’s go back
<br>
Let’s go back to Pleistocene
<br>
Way before civilization
<br>
to caveman nations
<br>
Oh and we’d dig through the gravel pit this morning
<br>
down to ancient wood beds
<br>
do some carbon dating
<br>
Glacial ice
<br>
The Laurentide
<br>
You came down and stopped by
<br>
Never have I imagined
<br>
how your legacy would be everlasting
<br>
Glacial ice crystal clean
<br>
under the blue sky
<br>
You came and went and came and went and came again
<br>
Then we'll turn around
<br>
Heading back to Holocene
<br>
The ice retreated
<br>
The lakes are depleted
<br>
All we have right now are tills full of debris
<br>
and the drumlins all around
<br>
and kettle moraines
<br>
Glacial ice
<br>
The Laurentide
<br>
You came down and stopped by
<br>
Never have I imagined
<br>
how your legacy would be everlasting
<br>
Glacial ice crystal clean
<br>
under the blue sky
<br>
You came and went and came and went and came again
<br>
Glacial ice
<br>
The Laurentide
<br>
You came down and stopped by
<br>
Never have I imagined
<br>
how your legacy would be everlasting
<br>
Glacial ice crystal clean
<br>
under the blue sky
<br>
You came and went and came and went and came again
