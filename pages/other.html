              <h2>Outreach</h2>
              <p class="text-body">I have been doing outreach and popsci writings in China for several years. I am in collaboration with several Chinese magazines, publishing houses and online platforms for outreach works. Topics of my outreach are mainly on geoscience and GIS but also include human geography, historical geography and others. My outreach articles and interviews on Chinese media (ebooks excluded) have reached 4.5 million views combined since January 1st 2018 (no statistics available for view counts before that date). I have hosted live or recorded outreach talks on various online platforms in China on topics of geology, geography and map design. I have also been invited to talk in communities and local primary/secondary schools to popularize geoscience among general public and also have (co-)organized multiple workshops on GIS, social science research and web mapping in Michigan and Oklahoma.</p>
		<h2>Hometown and Early Years</h2>
		<p>I was born in Chongqing, a hidden megacity in the mountainous southwestern China, and moved to Beijing at the age of 13. My interests in cartography, GIS and human geography were initiated by Chinese National Geographic magazines and world atlas in the school library during my junior high school years at Bashu Secondary School. I was formally introduced to ArcGIS and other geospatial software after I transferred to the High School Affiliated to Renmin University in Beijing during my 2nd year of junoir high school, and took my first GIS class at Beijing No.4 High School as an elective course during my senior high school years. My interests in geology and physical geography can also be traced back to my younger ages. There are lots of karst and structural landforms and fossil sites near my hometown, and they fascinated me deeply.</p>
		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>I am an indie songwriter in China and have recorded hundreds of demos of music pieces. I also wrote songs for school activities at other universities. You may check out some of my demos on the <a href="https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=28638572">163 Cloud Music</a>. I also received trainings on piano performing for more than 10 years.</p>
