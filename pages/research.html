	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>My M.S. thesis was on the application of numerical simulations (Finite Element Method) to the study of final geometries of buckling folds in initial settings with heterogeneous matrices. I am currently a research assistant in the EarthCube project at Wisconsin which utilizes computer technology and data sciences to explore the earth history in a more efficient way. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>I am fascinated by interdisciplinary research projects. Previously, I have utilized my specialties in geoscience and GIS in various interdisciplinary projects that are related to other fields including ecology, environmental sciences, social sciences, anthropology and history. For example, I took part in a research on recent induced earthquakes in Oklahoma. It combined tectonic study and spatial analysis, and we got some interesting results that people might never thought about before. Applying data sciences, spatial analysis, numerical methods and computer techniques to the study of geology is among my top interests. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>I participated in the Global Scholars Program at University of Michigan from 2013 to 2015. It gave me good opportunities to develop solid background on social justice and other aspects of social sciences. I also took various classes on human geography and history. Therefore, I always consider potential human factors and/or social impact when addressing geological and environmental issues. For example, I like thinking more about the vulnerability and challenges that the human society faces when geological hazards and climate changes occur. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>I consider both geology and geography as "visual" or "graphic" subjects, since a sketch or a map could be much more efficient than a thousand words in addressing a geological process or a spatial concept. This is why I am interested in all kinds of visualization. With some background and internship experiences on cartography, I have conducted several small-scaled projects on story-telling with maps and other types of visualization. In addition to ordinary story maps for social events, I'd like to extend this concept to the field of geoscience especially for purposes of science outreach. Showing the history of planet earth with maps and other figures to general public is more than exciting.</p>
