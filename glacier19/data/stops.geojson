The lake was located between Green Bay Lobe of the icesheet and the Jefferson moraine. 12000 years ago, Green Bay Lobe retreated farther north and opened the drainage route to another basin, so the lake level started to decline, and the lake vanished completely around 9000 years ago."

It is interpreted that the bulk part of this drumlin was formed by erosional process while the top till section might be formed by depositional process since fabrics within the top section of this drumlin have greater alignment than fabrics in lower sections.

    "Description":"This marsh is a remnant of a glacial lake. When Laurentide Ice Sheet was retreating, it left a recessional moraine that dammed melt water and formed a proglacial lake in this region. When the Rock River started to erode the moraine, the water level of this lake dropped and eventually it became a marsh. To the east, you can observe the Niagara Escarpment, a dolomite ridge extended from Door Peninsula to southeastern Wisconsin. Since dolomite is resistant, when Green Bay Lobe encountered the ridge from the west, it was compressed and thrusted so that more sediments were transported on top of the glacier, which contributed to the formation of the Kettle Moriane to the east of the Escarpment."
